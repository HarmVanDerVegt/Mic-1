A Mic-1 implementation in VHDL. The Mic-1 is a creation of Tanenbaum.

TODO:
- Implement branching logic
- Implement memory with program (Memory basics are there, figure out how to write the program there. Same method as control store?)
- Finish Z bit in alu (Currently blocks compilation).
- Check correct clock cycle, some signals trigger on rising_edge while they should trigger on falling_edge. (See Timing Mic-1).
- Tie it all together
